# RipeRide ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**

A route planning application designed to help you choose new paths and maximize route diversity.

RipeRide analyzes your cycling/running routes to help you choose paths that go in different directions and cover areas you haven't explored recently. Instead of repeating the same familiar routes, this app encourages exploration by:

- **Visualizing route coverage** across geographical grid squares
- **Identifying underexplored areas** through density heatmaps  
- **Comparing recent vs available routes** to find diversity opportunities
- **Maximizing spatial diversity** in your route selection
