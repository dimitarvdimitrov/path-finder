# RipeRide

**Fresh paths only.**

RipeRide connects to your Strava account and helps you pick the most rewarding route to ride next—based on what you’ve recently explored and what’s still ripe for the taking.

RipeRide ranks your saved routes on a scale from **tread → budding → ripe**, showing which routes you've covered recently and which are ready to ride. Instead of looping the same familiar paths, RipeRide nudges you toward variety and discovery.

### What it does

* **Analyzes route overlap** from your recent activity history (last 2 weeks)
* **Visualizes coverage** using a grid-based heatmap of your routes
* **Ranks your saved routes** based on spatial freshness
* **Surfaces underused paths** so you can ride what’s ripe, not what’s worn
